Hello person
Here are some words

Week 7 is "First Week" amd Week 8 is "Second Week" (somewhat Obviously)

The Jakeus Voice is the one that sounds like a synthesizer and  BF is the other one, or Jakeus is first voice, 
BF is second voice

Feel free to tinker with the file names and contents of the files themselves if you so need

I don't have seperate voice and inst files, cuz I'm lazy, but if you so need to add seperate files, here are the 
links to the soundtrap projects and you can like, export the seperate tracks:

https://www.soundtrap.com/signup?ref=8bcad493ea4c21ed2c02f779503bf655 - Saber (I think)
https://www.soundtrap.com/signup?ref=1894c48408bf5fb48d490f84f5da1542 - Ranked (I think)
https://www.soundtrap.com/signup?ref=c49aead9e5ebac5051b0678e5c9c4429 - Lawless (I think)
https://www.soundtrap.com/signup?ref=177f26370688128fcd75c9128db25884 - Vibro (I think)

If I end up wanting to change the mapping a bit, don't take any offense or anything because some notes are hard 
to hear and I probably will end up doing that

If it turns out I haven't added enough files, or something is wrong with them, PM me on gamebanana if that's 
even possible and I'll just do what you say
